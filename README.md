# Dustin Kelly's Tandem Code Challenge

Live Link: coming soon

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


## Goal
Your goal is to create an application that displays trivia questions with multiple-choice answers to select from.

Use creative license in terms of how you want us to see this game. At minimum, the player can view the question(s), the answer choices, the correct answer upon submission, and their score. It could be a user interface (UI), command-line-tool, etc. Feel free to use whatever framework or language you are comfortable with.
We would also like to see a README which includes any information about how to run the code, any known issues or complexity we should look out for, and any additional features you would like to have added to make your trivia app even more awesome.

### Assumptions
- A round of trivia has 10 Questions
- All questions are multiple-choice questions
- Your score does not need to update in real time
- Results can update on form submit, button click, or any interaction you choose
- We will provide you with the trivia data such as the questions, correct and incorrect answers via a JSON file.


Acceptance Criteria
- A user can view questions.
- Questions with their multiple choice options must be displayed one at a time.  
- Questions should not repeat in a round.
- A user can select only 1 answer out of the 4 possible answers.
- The correct answer must be revealed after a user has submitted their answer 
- A user can see the score they received at the end of the round
